\subsection{Purpose of the System} % Sub-section


Emoji Strike is a 2-D arcade game. The game is designed so that a group of friends can have good a time playing the game on the same device competitively. The game firstly introduces the user with a brief tutorial to teach the user how the game is played. As the user(s) decide that they have learned this gameplay and controls, they move on to the game building stage which includes user’s picking their desired character and map of choice. When this game building stage is done users can enjoy the game they built for themselves until one of the them becomes the victor. Therefore, our main purpose is to design a dynamic and a competitive game.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Software Architecture} % Major section

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Overview} % Sub-section

This section will decompose our program into smaller, more manageable parts, so that it may be built more efficiently and cleanly. Additionally, partitioning the sections will mean that the different program parts will not interfere with each other, and one misbehaving section may not disturb other sections. We will try to use a Model-View-Controller style architecture on our program.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Subsystem Decomposition} % Sub-section

To ensure that our system contains maintanable, discrete, independant sections, we will break it up into 3 section: mainly the User Interface Section, which will serves as the view, the Game Management Section, which serves as the controller, and the Game system itself, which is the model. This way, we can not only independantly develop the sections, but also prevent bugs from one section from leaking into others. Additionally, our code will remain maintainable in the future, since related functionalities will be grouped together and the future maintainers will have a well-documented and partitioned system to maintain.
\indent Below are diagrams indicating how the system and actions inside it are divided up. They can serve not only as guidelines while the system is being developed, but also as references for the future when the system is already running.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Architectural Styles} % Sub-section

%------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Layers} % Subsub-section

This system has been divided into three layers, which are closely mirrored by the MVC-style architectre the entire program follows. The top-most layer, the User-Interface Layer, is the one that is in direct contact with the user. It is the only layer which the user is allowed to directly influence. Beneath this comes the Game Management layer, which is synonomous to the Game Management subsystem. This can only be influenced by the User Interface layer, and directly influences the Game layer. It serves as a pipeline between what the user sees and the actual system, and transfers any changes from one end to the other. Finally, comes the Game layer, which can be considered to be the engine of the entire system. It is the actual state of the system, and is altered directly by the Game Management layer. Changes are passed back through the same layer. This layered system has been created to prevent any undue influencing of the system by the user, so that only appropriate layers can be changed, and these changes are done in a controlled, pre-decided manner.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Model View Controller} % Subsub-section

The Model-View-Controller style serves as a complement to the layer sytle described above. It divides the system into the Model, which cannot be altered directly by anybody except the Controller, which is merged with the View to display the whole program to the user. Since our program is a gme, it is especially useful for our system to be divided as an MVC-style architecture, since the game state must be influenced only by the user, but must also not be freely changed, and should instead have a controlled pathway for changes to take the proper effect.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Hardware/Software Mapping} % Sub-section

EmojiStrike will be implemented in Java, and will use JDK 1.8. The hardware used are a keyboard, speakers, and the monitor display. The software needed is only an operating systme which can run the .jar file which will contain our game. Storage will be done in .txt format, so the operating system should be able to store the saved files.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Persistent Data Management} % Sub-section

The game does not have any complex or detailed information that needs to be stored. The default maps will be stored, and the edited versions with other game details will be stored as individual files. The game will be able to function if the saved files are corrupted, although the saved game will obviously be lost. Sound files and images for the emojis, weapons, and animations will also be stored, and if these are corrupted, the game will experience significant problems.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Access Control and  Security} % Sub-section

There are no network or security requirements for this game.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Boundary Conditions} % Sub-section
Below is a list of boundary conditions in our application.\\
\textbf{Initialization:} There is no need for any installation. Simply running the main .jar file is enough to run the game, as long as the system has Java installed.\\
\textbf{Termination:} The system can exit with a simple keypress, both with or without saving the game. Saving the game will also require the user to enter a name for the current game.\\
\textbf{Error:} The game may not load saved games if the files are corrupted.\\
The game may not load certain images or sounds if the files are corrupted.\\
		An error while playing the game might cause the entire system to shut down, but we will try to include ways to handle all errors and maintain user experience.\\

\section{Subsystem Design} % Major section

In this section, we will bridge the gap between a problem and an existing system in a manageable way by using divide and conquer approach.

User Interface Management Subsystem consists of 11 classes which contains the views and information necessary to establish communication between users and Emoji Strike.  There are two interfaces implemented and used during the design of out interface.  These classes and their properties will be discussed in-depth in the following sections.
