The three pieces of hardware in the system will be a keyboard, speakers, and a monitor. The keyboard will allow users to enter commands to be interpreted by the game, and the changes will work in real-time. The speakers will play sounds related to the gameplay in order to create a better user experience. The monitor will display the game to the user. The monitors and speakers will change depending on the input from the keyboard. Both of them will also perform in real-time.
